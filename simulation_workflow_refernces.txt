The simulation workflow:

Acquires route data using Google Maps API (origin, destination, elevation, road segments)
Generates a realistic driving cycle based on the route data
Creates a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) model using Virtual Vehicle Composer (or a simplified alternative)
Simulates the trip to evaluate energy consumption and performance metrics
Visualizes and analyzes the results
Requirements
MATLAB R2022a or newer
Simulink
Optional (but recommended):
Virtual Vehicle Composer
Powertrain Blockset
Mapping Toolbox
Setup Instructions
Google Maps API Key:
Obtain a Google Maps API key with access to:
Directions API
Elevation API
Distance Matrix API
Add your API key to the apiKey variable in the main script
MATLAB Dependencies:
If you have Virtual Vehicle Composer, ensure it's properly installed
If not, the code will automatically use a simplified BEV model
Running the Simulation
Open MATLAB
Navigate to the project directory
Edit the main_script.m file:
Replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' with your actual API key
Modify the origin and destination as needed
Adjust vehicle parameters to match your desired BEV configuration
Run the main_script.m file
Review the simulation results
Files Description
main_script.m: The main script that coordinates the entire simulation workflow
generateDrivingCycle.m: Function to create a realistic driving cycle from route data
createBEVModel.m: Function to create a Battery Electric Vehicle model using Virtual Vehicle Composer
Example Output
The simulation will generate:

A visualization of the route, speed profile, elevation changes, and energy consumption
Performance metrics including:
Battery State of Charge (SOC)
Energy consumption (kWh)
Energy efficiency (Wh/km)
Estimated range
Trip cost
Saved data files for further analysis
