Battery Electric Vehicle Route Energy Simulation
Executive Summary
We propose a novel simulation framework that merges real-time mapping data with advanced vehicle modeling to accurately predict energy consumption for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This solution addresses the critical market need for reliable range estimationâ€”a key factor limiting widespread BEV adoption. By integrating Google Maps API with sophisticated BEV models, our approach provides unprecedented accuracy in trip planning and energy management for electric vehicle users.
Problem Statement
Range anxiety continues to be a significant barrier to electric vehicle adoption. Current energy estimation methods fail to account for the complex interplay between:

Route-specific elevation changes
Real-time traffic conditions
Driver behavior patterns
Environmental factors
Vehicle-specific performance characteristics

This results in unreliable range predictions, suboptimal route planning, and underutilized BEV capabilities.
Our Solution
Our proposed simulation framework creates a comprehensive end-to-end workflow that:

Leverages real-world data by integrating Google Maps API to capture actual route topology, traffic conditions, and elevation profiles
Generates realistic driving cycles customized to specific routes rather than using generic test cycles
Employs advanced BEV modeling with accurate powertrain dynamics, battery characteristics, and thermal effects
Delivers actionable insights including energy consumption forecasts, optimal routing, and performance metrics

Technical Approach
The solution integrates three core technical components:
1. Dynamic Route Data Acquisition

Secure real-time route information through Google Maps API integration
